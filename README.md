## ‚ú® Features

* **Task Management**: Easily add new tasks, specifying a name, priority (High, Medium, Low), and estimated duration.
* **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Tasks are intelligently prioritized to ensure critical activities are placed effectively within your schedule.
* **Intelligent Scheduling (API-Driven)**: The application is designed to integrate with an external API service for advanced, AI-powered schedule optimization, aiming to provide the most efficient task arrangement.
* **Persistent Task Storage**: Your added tasks are securely stored locally in your browser's storage, ensuring your task list remains intact across sessions.
* **Dynamic Schedule Generation**: Instantly generates a structured schedule based on your current task list with a single click.
* **Productivity Insights**: Receive valuable productivity tips with each generated schedule to enhance your workflow.

## üöÄ How to Use

To maximize your productivity with the Time Management Coach:

1.  **Adding a Task**:
    * Locate the input fields at the top of the application.
    * Enter a concise **Task name** (e.g., "Prepare presentation for client meeting").
    * Select the appropriate **Priority** from the dropdown menu (High, Medium, or Low), reflecting the task's urgency and importance.
    * Input the estimated **Duration** in minutes (e.g., "90" for an hour and a half).
    * Click the **"Add Task"** button to append it to your task list.
2.  **Managing Your Tasks**:
    * Your added tasks will be displayed in a list below the input area.
    * To remove a task, simply click the **"√ó"** button positioned next to the task item.
3.  **Generating Your Schedule**:
    * Once all your tasks are entered and organized, click the prominent **"Generate Schedule"** button.
    * The application will then process your tasks and display a detailed, optimized schedule, indicating start and end times for each activity.

## ü§ñ How the Scheduling API Works (Simulated)

The core intelligence behind the schedule generation is designed to interact with an external API. When you click "Generate Schedule":

1.  **Data Transmission**: The application gathers all your entered tasks, including their names, priorities, and durations.
2.  **API Request**: This task data is then sent as a request to a designated API endpoint (simulated in this demo). In a real-world scenario, this API would typically host an AI or optimization algorithm.
3.  **Intelligent Processing**: The external API (or its simulated counterpart) processes the task data, applying sophisticated algorithms to determine the most efficient order and time slots for each task, considering factors like priority and duration.
4.  **Schedule Reception**: The optimized schedule is then returned from the API to your browser.
5.  **Display**: The application takes the received schedule data and renders it clearly on your screen, providing your personalized daily plan.

**Note**: For this particular demonstration, the API interaction is simulated using an enhanced local algorithm that mimics AI behavior. In a production system, you'd replace this with actual API calls to a powerful AI backend (e.g., using Google's Gemini API, OpenAI's GPT, or a custom optimization service). The `API_KEY` in `script.js` is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual, securely managed API key for live deployment.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure and content for the web application.
* **CSS3**: Styles the application, ensuring a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript**: Powers all interactive elements, handles task management, manages local storage, and orchestrates the communication for schedule generation.

## üåê How to Host Live

This project is structured for easy deployment to live web hosting environments. Here's how you can typically host it:

1.  **Prepare Files**: Ensure you have the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files in a single directory.
2.  **Choose a Hosting Service**: Popular choices for static site hosting include:
    * **Netlify**: Highly recommended for its simplicity and direct deployment from a folder or Git repository.
    * **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, offering quick deployments for front-end projects.
    * **GitHub Pages**: Great for hosting directly from a GitHub repository.
    * **Firebase Hosting**: Google's hosting solution, part of the Firebase platform.
3.  **Deployment Steps (Example using Netlify)**:
    * **Manual Deploy**:
        * Go to the Netlify app.
        * Drag and drop the folder containing your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files directly into the designated drop zone.
        * Netlify will automatically detect the files and deploy your site, providing you with a live URL.
    * **Deploy from Git (Recommended)**:
        * Upload your project files to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
        * Connect your Netlify account to your Git provider.
        * Select your repository, configure basic build settings (usually default for this project), and deploy. Netlify will automatically redeploy your site whenever you push changes to your repository.

Once deployed, your Time Management Coach will be live and accessible via the provided URL.
