## 🚀 How to Use

To maximize your productivity with the Time Management Coach:

1.  **Adding a Task**:
    * Locate the input fields at the top of the application.
    * Enter a concise **Task name** (e.g., "Prepare presentation for client meeting").
    * Select the appropriate **Priority** from the dropdown menu (High, Medium, or Low), reflecting the task's urgency and importance.
    * Input the estimated **Duration** in minutes (e.g., "90" for an hour and a half).
    * Click the **"Add Task"** button to append it to your task list.
2.  **Managing Your Tasks**:
    * Your added tasks will be displayed in a list below the input area.
    * To remove a task, simply click the **"×"** button positioned next to the task item.
3.  **Generating Your Schedule**:
    * Once all your tasks are entered and organized, click the prominent **"Generate Schedule"** button.
    * The application will then process your tasks and display a detailed, optimized schedule, indicating start and end times for each activity.

## 🤖 How the Scheduling API Works (Simulated)

The core intelligence behind the schedule generation is designed to interact with an external API. When you click "Generate Schedule":

1.  **Data Transmission**: The application gathers all your entered tasks, including their names, priorities, and durations.
2.  **API Request**: This task data is then sent as a request to a designated API endpoint (simulated in this demo). In a real-world scenario, this API would typically host an AI or optimization algorithm.
3.  **Intelligent Processing**: The external API (or its simulated counterpart) processes the task data, applying sophisticated algorithms to determine the most efficient order and time slots for each task, considering factors like priority and duration.
4.  **Schedule Reception**: The optimized schedule is then returned from the API to your browser.
5.  **Display**: The application takes the received schedule data and renders it clearly on your screen, providing your personalized daily plan.

**Note**: For this particular demonstration, the API interaction is simulated using an enhanced local algorithm that mimics AI behavior. In a production system, you'd replace this with actual API calls to a powerful AI backend (e.g., using Google's Gemini API, OpenAI's GPT, or a custom optimization service). The `API_KEY` in `script.js` is a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual, securely managed API key for live deployment.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure and content for the web application.
* **CSS3**: Styles the application, ensuring a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript**: Powers all interactive elements, handles task management, manages local storage, and orchestrates the communication for schedule generation.

## 🚀 Deployment & Hosting

This project is built as a static site, making it incredibly simple to deploy live on the web.

### 1\. Using GitHub

The primary way to manage and share this project is via GitHub:

  * **Repository Setup**: Create a new repository on GitHub.
  * **Upload Files**: Upload all your project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `netlify.toml`, and the `netlify/functions` folder if you've implemented serverless functions) to this GitHub repository.
  * **Version Control**: GitHub provides version control, allowing you to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous versions.

### 2\. Hosting on Netlify (Highly Recommended)

Netlify provides incredibly easy and powerful hosting for static sites directly from your GitHub repository.

  * **Connect Netlify to GitHub**:
    1.  Go to the [Netlify website](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in (or sign up).
    2.  Click on "Add new site" -\> "Import an existing project" -\> "Deploy with GitHub".
    3.  Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories.
    4.  Select your Time Management Coach repository.
    5.  Netlify will usually auto-detect your build settings. For this project, you typically won't need to change much (e.g., build command can be left empty, publish directory usually defaults to the root). If you set up Netlify Functions, ensure your `netlify.toml` is correctly configured.
    6.  Click "Deploy site".
  * **Automatic Deployments**: Once connected, every time you push changes to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically build and redeploy your site, ensuring your live demo is always up-to-date.
  * **Environment Variables for API Keys**: If you implement serverless functions to hide your API key, you'll set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or similar) in your Netlify site settings under **Site settings** -\> **Build & deploy** -\> **Environment variables**.
